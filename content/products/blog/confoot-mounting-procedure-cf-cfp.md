Introducing the ConFoot CFP Set—a purpose-built, efficient solution designed for effortless container handling. Developed to simplify installation and maximize stability without the need for a chassis, this product is ideal for use in locations lacking permanent infrastructure. Below you’ll find an in-depth overview of the product’s components, tools needed, and step-by-step instructions for a secure and reliable installation.

## Product Overview and Key Components

The ConFoot CFP Set is engineered with durability and ease-of-use in mind. It includes the following primary components:

- • CFP Legs: Lightweight yet robust high-strength aluminum supports that provide the necessary stability for containers.
- • Corner Castings: Specialized mounting points on the container that receive the CFP legs securely.
- • Height Adjustment Mechanism: Enables precise height configuration to match various ground levels or loading bay heights.
- • Locking Pins and Safety Clips: Ensure each leg remains fastened, delivering consistent performance and safety.

Having all the right components guarantees a smoother process during container installation, streamlining handling operations and reducing the risk of misalignment or instability.

## Essential Tools for Installation

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools available:

- A wrench or spanner for tightening bolts and locking pins.
- A level for confirming precise height adjustments.
- Safety gloves to protect your hands when handling components.
- A checklist to verify that all necessary parts are on hand.

Using the correct tools ensures that the installation process is efficient and maintains the product’s high safety standards.

## Installation and Mounting Procedure

Designed for simplicity and flexibility, the mounting procedure for the CFP Set is clearly defined to maximize performance. Follow these steps to ensure proper installation:

### Secure Attachment to Container Corner Castings

1. Position your container on a flat, stable surface to prevent any movement during installation.
2. If using a truck chassis, secure the container firmly to avoid shifting.
3. Inspect corner castings to confirm they are free from debris or damage, ensuring perfect alignment for the CFP legs.

### Mounting the CFP Legs

1. Extend the CFP legs to the desired height before mounting.
2. Carefully align each leg with its designated corner casting—front corners for CF legs and rear corners for CFP legs—to guarantee balanced support.
3. Insert the legs into position and secure with locking pins and safety clips. Double-check every connection to ensure safety and stability.

### Height Adjustment for Optimal Use

1. Once all legs are in place, employ the height adjustment mechanism to adapt the container to the loading bay or ground level.
2. Use a level to verify that the container stands perfectly even. Small adjustments may be needed to achieve a level setup.
3. Confirm that the container’s alignment meets operational requirements to support efficient loading and unloading processes.

## Safety and Best Practices

To maintain high performance and safety:

- Always ensure every CFP leg is firmly secured. Loose connections can jeopardize stability.
- Regularly verify that all adjustments are even; an unbalanced container risks operational hazards.
- Periodically inspect all parts for signs of wear or damage, and replace any faulty components promptly.
- Adhere to manufacturer guidelines regarding weight capacity and proper usage to avoid overloading.

## Troubleshooting and Maintenance

Should you encounter issues during installation, consider the following tips:

• Alignment Problems:  
– Check for debris or damage in the corner casting slots.  
– Confirm that each CFP leg is fully extended and correctly positioned before securing.

• Handling Component Damage:  
– Never use a damaged CFP leg or a compromised corner casting.  
– Replace any faulty parts immediately to uphold operational safety and product integrity.

## Designed for Varied Surfaces

For installations on uneven ground, use the height adjustment mechanism to ensure that the container remains level. Gently press each corner after adjustment to verify that there is no wobble, ensuring optimal stability during operations.
