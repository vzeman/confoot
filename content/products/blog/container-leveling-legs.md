Product: Shipping Container Leveling Legs  
─────────────────────────────  
Overview:  
Shipping Container Leveling Legs are adjustable supports engineered to stabilize and level ISO containers on uneven or sloped surfaces. Designed for secure attachment to the container’s standard corner castings, these leveling legs create a flat, stable base that enhances the container’s structural strength and operational efficiency.

Key Features and Benefits

1. Enhanced Stability and Safety  
 • Optimally supports heavy loads and maintains a level container position even on uneven ground.  
 • Prevents tilting and shifting so that doors and components align correctly, reducing the risk of accidents.  

2. Precise Ease-of-Use  
 • Adjustable design enables fine height adjustments with minimal effort.  
 • A precise leveling mechanism ensures each leg aligns the container accurately without relying on temporary measures such as wooden blocks or gravel.  

3. Prolonged Container Lifespan  
 • Even weight distribution and raised clearance help avoid water pooling that could lead to corrosion or structural stress.  
 • Regular use significantly reduces risks of warping, cracking, or misaligned doors, lowering long-term maintenance and repair costs.

Installation & Setup Guidelines

Step 1: Site Preparation  
 • Ensure that the container’s siting area is clear of debris, vegetation, or obstacles.  
 • Check that the ground is compact and as flat as possible; mark the attachment points at the container’s corners.  
 • For enhanced stability, consider preparing a foundation such as concrete pads.

Step 2: Attaching the Leveling Legs  
 • Align each leg with the container’s corner castings.  
 • Use the provided bolts or clamps to securely attach the legs—but be sure not to over-tighten to avoid damage.

Step 3: Adjusting the Height  
 • Using the adjustable mechanism, raise or lower each leg until the container is evenly level.  
 • A spirit level placed on the container floor can help verify proper alignment.

Step 4: Securing and Testing Stability  
 • Recheck all bolts and fastenings to ensure firm installation.  
 • Gently test the container’s stability; if available, anchor the leveling legs to the ground to further prevent movement.

Maintenance and Care

• Regular Cleaning & Lubrication  
 – Wipe down the legs with a damp cloth or mild detergent to remove dirt and moisture.  
 – Dry completely and apply a high-quality, weather-resistant lubricant to joints and adjustable mechanisms.

• Damage Inspection  
 – Periodically inspect for any signs of rust, cracks, or bending.  
 – Ensure that all bolts and fasteners remain secure and corrosion-free; replace any damaged components immediately.

• Proper Storage  
 – When not in use, store the leveling legs in a dry, covered environment or use protective covers to shield them from harsh weather.
