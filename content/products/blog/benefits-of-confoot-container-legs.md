### Product Overview: Shipping Container Legs

Our Shipping Container Legs are engineered precision tools designed to transform logistics operations. These innovative products allow trucks to detach seamlessly from shipping containers during loading and unloading. This means drivers can promptly depart and proceed to their next assignment, increasing fleet productivity and reducing unnecessary downtime.

### Key Features and Compatibility

• Designed to attach securely to the underside of standard shipping containers  
• Compatible with a wide range of container sizes, making them ideal for various logistics needs  
• Equipped with retractable legs that extend to provide stable support when separated from the truck  
• Simple, intuitive design for easy operation in dynamic field conditions  

### How It Works: Step-by-Step Product Functionality

{{< youtube id="f8Q_VYnZbMQ" title="ConFoot Container Legs Demo" >}}

1. Attaching the Legs:  
   Prior to arrival at the drop-off point, the driver securely fastens the container legs to designated points on the container. Once extended, these legs stabilize the container effectively.

2. Detaching the Container:  
   At the unloading destination, the container is effortlessly detached from the truck. The extended legs provide immediate stability, allowing the truck to leave promptly without waiting on manual operations.

3. Efficient Reattachment:  
   Upon the container’s loading or emptying, the truck returns. The driver then positions the truck beneath the container, retracts the legs, and reattaches the container quickly.  

This streamlined process is designed to save time, simplify operations, and boost overall productivity.
