**Installation Process Breakdown**

**Mounting the CFP Set on the Container**  
Ensure the container is positioned on a flat, stable surface during installation:
1. Start by verifying the container rests on a stable base. If connected to a truck chassis, confirm it is properly secured to avoid any movement.
2. Inspect and clean the corner castings to remove debris or damage, ensuring a perfect fit for the CFP legs.

**Step-by-Step Installation Instructions**

1. **Deploying the CFP Legs**
   - Extend the CFP legs to the recommended height before attaching them.
   - Align each leg accurately with its designated corner casting.
   - Insert the leg into the slot and secure it using the provided locking pins and safety clips.
   - Verify that all connections are tight and secure.

2. **Adjusting for Optimal Loading Bay Compatibility**
   - Use the height adjustment mechanism once all legs are installed to ensure the container meets the loading bay level.
   - Use a level to check for uniform alignment, making fine adjustments as necessary.
   - Confirm that the container sits evenly to maintain stability during operations.

**Distinguishing Leg Positions**
- • CF Legs: Positioned at the container’s front corners.
- • CFP Legs: Installed at the rear, ensuring balanced support and overall stability.

**Safety and Best Practices**

**Ensuring Secure Installation**
- Always double-check that each leg is firmly attached to the corresponding corner casting. Loose connections can lead to instability and potential safety hazards.
- Consistently use the level to maintain even height adjustments, as an unbalanced container increases risk during loading and unloading.

**Additional Safety Guidelines**
- Regularly inspect all components for wear or damage, and replace any faulty parts immediately.
- Adhere to the manufacturer’s guidelines regarding weight capacity and installation procedures.
- Clear the work area of obstacles before starting the installation process.

**Troubleshooting and Maintenance**

**Handling Alignment and Component Issues**
- If a leg fails to align with the corner casting, check for debris or damage in the mounting area. Ensure the leg is fully extended and correctly positioned before securing it.
- Do not use any components that appear damaged or faulty; replace them promptly to maintain the product's integrity.

**Adapting to Uneven Ground**
- When installation occurs on uneven surfaces, utilize the height adjustment mechanism to level the container.
- Test the setup by gently pressing on each corner to confirm stability, adjusting as necessary to prevent tilting.
