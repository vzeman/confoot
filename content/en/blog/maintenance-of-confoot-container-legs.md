The maintenance of ConFoot container legs is crucial to ensure their longevity and operational safety. Regular inspections of mechanical parts, including cotter pins, are highly recommended. Below are detailed guidelines for maintaining ConFoot container legs:

1. **Visual Inspection**: Regularly check for any visible damage, wear, or deformities on the legs. Look for cracks, bends, or any structural changes.

2. **Functional Testing**: Test the legs to ensure they are operating smoothly. This includes extending and retracting the legs to check for any mechanical resistance or unusual sounds.

3. **Cotter Pin Check**: Cotter pins are small but critical components that secure various parts of the ConFoot legs. Ensure they are not bent, corroded, or missing. Replace any damaged or missing cotter pins immediately to avoid operational failures.

4. **Lubrication**: Apply appropriate lubrication to moving parts to prevent rust and ensure smooth operation. Avoid using excessive lubrication, as this can attract dirt and debris.

5. **Annual Expert Inspection**: It is recommended to have an expert inspector perform a detailed annual check-up. This should include both visual and functional testing, as well as a thorough examination of all mechanical components.
