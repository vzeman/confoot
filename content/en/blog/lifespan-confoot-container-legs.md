summary: "The lifespan of ConFoot container legs."
---

The lifespan of ConFoot container legs, like any shipping container component, is significantly influenced by regular maintenance. While shipping containers themselves can last anywhere from 10 to 25 years with minimal maintenance, and potentially up to 50 years with diligent care, the lifespan of the legs can be similarly extended through proactive maintenance practices.

ConFoot specifically recommends the following maintenance procedures to maximize the lifespan and ensure the safe operation of their container legs:

1.  **Visual Inspection:** Regularly check the legs for any visible signs of damage, wear, or deformities. Look for cracks, bends, or any structural changes that could compromise their integrity.
2.  **Functional Testing:** Periodically test the legs to ensure they are operating smoothly. This includes extending and retracting the legs to check for any mechanical resistance or unusual sounds. This helps identify potential issues early on.
3.  **Cotter Pin Check:** Cotter pins are critical for securing various parts of the ConFoot legs. Ensure these pins are not bent, corroded, or missing. Replace any damaged or missing cotter pins immediately to prevent operational failures.
4.  **Lubrication:** Apply appropriate lubrication to moving parts to prevent rust and ensure smooth operation. Be careful not to over-lubricate, as excessive lubrication can attract dirt and debris, which can be counterproductive.
5.  **Annual Expert Inspection:** ConFoot recommends having a qualified inspector perform a detailed annual check-up. This inspection should include both visual and functional testing, as well as a thorough examination of all mechanical components.

By consistently following these maintenance guidelines, you can significantly extend the lifespan of your ConFoot container legs and ensure they continue to perform reliably. Neglecting maintenance can lead to premature wear and tear, potentially shortening their lifespan and increasing the risk of operational issues.
