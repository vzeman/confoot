  ## What is ConFoot-leg CF?

  ConFoot-leg CF is the standard model container leg designed to streamline transport, storage, and logistics operations. This versatile solution reduces the time required to move and unload containers by allowing containers to be left waiting for unloading, meaning drivers don't have to wait. The CF model transforms shipping containers into flexible storage units that remain ready for transport whenever needed.

  ## Key Benefits for Transport and Logistics

  The ConFoot-leg CF provides significant operational advantages for businesses involved in container transport and logistics. By enabling containers to be left on legs while waiting for unloading, you can optimize driver time and fleet utilization. Drivers can drop off containers and immediately continue to their next assignment, eliminating costly waiting periods during loading and unloading operations.

  Additionally, containers equipped with CF legs can serve as valuable additional storage space when not in transit. They remain ready to be moved at any time - simply drive a trailer under the container, and the journey continues. This versatility makes the CF an ideal solution for businesses looking to enhance their logistics efficiency and storage capacity.

  ## How It Works

  The ConFoot-leg CF attaches securely to container corner castings, providing stable support while the container is positioned for loading, unloading, or storage. The legs feature an adjustment range of 1,043 mm to 1,448 mm, allowing for versatile positioning in various operational environments. Each leg weighs 24 kg, making them manageable for operators to handle, while the system provides a substantial load capacity of 34 tons.

  The installation process is straightforward:
  1. Position the CF legs at the container corner castings
  2. Engage the locking mechanism to secure the legs
  3. Adjust the height as needed for your specific requirements
  4. Lower the trailer and drive away, leaving the container safely supported on the legs

  When it's time to move the container, simply drive the trailer back under it, secure the container to the trailer, remove the legs, and continue the journey.

  ## Applications of ConFoot-leg CF

  ### Transport Companies
  Transport companies benefit significantly from the CF's ability to optimize fleet utilization. Drivers can drop containers at customer locations and immediately continue to their next assignment, rather than waiting for loading/unloading operations. This efficiency can substantially increase the productive capacity of existing trailer fleets and reduce operational costs.

  ### Warehousing and Distribution
  For warehousing and distribution operations, the CF provides valuable flexibility in managing container flows. Containers can be positioned in temporary storage areas on legs, creating additional buffer capacity during peak periods. This approach reduces congestion at loading docks and allows for more efficient scheduling of loading and unloading operations.

  ### Manufacturing Facilities
  Manufacturing facilities can use CF-equipped containers as flexible additional storage for raw materials or finished products. By positioning containers close to production areas, materials can be easily accessed when needed, reducing handling costs and improving production efficiency.

  ### Retail Operations
  Retail businesses can utilize CF legs for seasonal storage solutions, with containers positioned at strategic locations to support inventory management during peak periods. This approach provides cost-effective additional capacity without the need for permanent facility expansion.
