  ## What is ConFoot CFU?

  ConFoot CFU is a height-adjustable container foot solution designed to provide maximum versatility and flexibility in container handling. This innovative system allows you to adjust container height from ground level to over a meter (0-1,500 mm), with no additional equipment needed for container handling. The CFU model stands out for its ability to work with standard shipping containers in various environments and for different purposes, making it an ideal choice for businesses across multiple industries.

  ## How It Works

  The ConFoot CFU attaches directly to container corner castings, providing a stable base for loading, unloading, and temporary storage. Its adjustable design ensures flexibility in positioning containers at the optimal height for your specific needs. The system consists of several parts with individual piece weight under 25 kg, making it manageable for operators to handle, while the total leg weight when assembled is 46 kg. The straightforward attachment mechanism allows for quick deployment and removal, significantly reducing the time and resources needed for container handling operations.

  ## Applications of ConFoot CFU
