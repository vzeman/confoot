  ## What is ConFoot-leg CFL?

  ConFoot-leg CFL is a specialized container leg solution designed specifically for framed containers. Unlike standard shipping containers, spherical containers used for transporting liquids requiring high pressure endurance need frames around them to be transportable, as the spheric form carries the pressure best. The CFL model is engineered to fit these frames perfectly, allowing these specialized containers to be used as storage containers for liquids and other materials that require pressure resistance.

  ## Key Benefits for Specialized Container Handling

  The ConFoot-leg CFL provides significant operational advantages for businesses that handle framed containers, particularly those used for liquid transport and storage. By enabling these specialized containers to be placed on legs, you can create flexible storage solutions for liquids and other pressure-sensitive materials without the need for permanent infrastructure.

  The CFL model allows businesses to optimize their specialized container operations, providing a way to safely support framed containers during loading, unloading, and storage periods. This versatility makes the CFL an ideal solution for industries that rely on the transport and storage of liquids and other materials requiring pressure-resistant containers.

  ## How It Works

  The ConFoot-leg CFL attaches securely to the frames of specialized containers, providing stable support while the container is positioned for loading, unloading, or storage. The legs feature an adjustment range of 1,043 mm to 1,448 mm, allowing for versatile positioning in various operational environments. Each leg weighs 24 kg, making them manageable for operators to handle, while the system provides a substantial load capacity of 30 tons.

  The installation process is straightforward:
  1. Position the CFL legs at the container frame corners
  2. Engage the locking mechanism to secure the legs
  3. Adjust the height as needed for your specific requirements
  4. Lower the trailer and drive away, leaving the container safely supported on the legs

  When it's time to move the container, simply drive the trailer back under it, secure the container to the trailer, remove the legs, and continue the journey.

  ## Applications of ConFoot-leg CFL

  ### Chemical Industry
  The chemical industry benefits significantly from the CFL's ability to safely support containers used for storing and transporting chemicals and liquid materials. By enabling these specialized containers to be positioned on legs, companies can create flexible storage solutions that maintain the integrity of pressure-sensitive materials while optimizing space utilization.

  ### Oil and Gas Sector
  For the oil and gas sector, the CFL provides valuable flexibility in handling containers used for various petroleum products. The ability to safely position these containers on legs allows for more efficient loading and unloading operations, as well as creating temporary storage capacity during peak operational periods.

  ### Food and Beverage Industry
  The food and beverage industry can utilize CFL legs for containers used in transporting and storing liquid food products. The system's stability and reliability ensure that these sensitive materials can be safely handled and stored without risk of contamination or damage.

  ### Water Treatment and Supply
  Water treatment and supply operations can benefit from the CFL's ability to support containers used for storing and transporting water treatment chemicals and other liquid materials. This capability enables more flexible and efficient management of these essential resources.
