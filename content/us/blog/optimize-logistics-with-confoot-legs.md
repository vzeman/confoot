### Company and Product History of ConFoot

In the early 2000s, Timo Akela, the CEO of ConFoot, encountered a challenging logistics problem. His close friend, Veikko Salminen, ran a small company that imported furniture from Estonia and supplied it to retailers in Finland. With limited resources and a small fleet, Veikko struggled with an inefficient delivery process.

When Veikko arrived at retailers, staff often had to unload the furniture, and the stores lacked designated storage areas and teams for rapid unloading—resulting in long delays. Some stores even requested that he return the next day to pick up the empty container. This led to as many as three containers being parked simultaneously at different retailers’ loading ramps. With trailers tied up and slow turnover, it was clear a solution was necessary.

Veikko soon realized he wasn’t the only transporter facing these issues. He turned to Timo and asked, "How can we get a shipping container off a trailer without expensive equipment?" This challenge spurred Timo to search for an innovative solution to simplify container handling and boost transport efficiency.

### Birth of the Innovative Idea

Timo teamed up with Veikko and his brother-in-law, Terho Närevaara. Together, they began developing the concept of a lightweight, affordable set of legs or supports that would enable the easy removal of a shipping container from a trailer. These supports were designed to attach to the container’s corner castings so that the truck could lower the trailer’s air suspension and simply drive away, leaving the container in place for unloading. This innovation dramatically increased the driver’s productivity and reduced delivery delays.

### Challenges in Development

Implementing this idea wasn’t straightforward. The ConFoot team set several key requirements for the final product:

* **Lightweight:** It had to be easily portable and operable by one person.  
* **Low Cost:** Affordability was crucial for broad market acceptance.  
* **Long Lifespan:** The supports needed to be durable and reliable for regular use.  
* **Safety:** They had to meet all safety regulations as outlined by European machinery directives.

Achieving these goals involved extensive 3D modeling, rigorous load testing, and detailed material strength calculations. While the concept appeared simple, its execution required the collaboration of numerous experts and engineers.

### First Prototypes and Their Shortcomings

During development, several prototypes were built, including one shaped like an "I" and others made primarily of aluminum. However, these early models did not meet the team’s high standards—they weren’t strong, portable, or durable enough to withstand the rigors of heavy container transportation.

### Breakthrough and Patent of the Innovation

In 2013, after over a decade of intensive research and development, the ConFoot team achieved a breakthrough. They discovered a unique blend of six different types of high-strength, high-quality Finnish steel that enabled the creation of supports meeting all the necessary requirements. The new ConFoot legs were capable of bearing loads up to 26 tons while weighing only 24 kg.

This breakthrough was immediately patented and laid the foundation for the company’s future success. Around the same time, Timo officially established ConFoot Oy in Helsinki, further bolstering the brand’s credibility and professionalism.

### Further Improvements Based on Feedback

The ConFoot team continually listened to customer feedback, making additional enhancements along the way:
