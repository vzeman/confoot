## Are ConFoot Container Legs Certified?

Yes, ConFoot container legs are certified to meet stringent safety and quality standards. This certification ensures that the legs are suitable for use with all types of containers, including refrigerated and tank containers. ConFoot's commitment to certification provides users with confidence in the reliability and safety of their products.

### CE Certification

ConFoot legs are CE-certified, indicating that they conform to health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area (EEA). CE marking is a declaration by the manufacturer that the product meets all the appropriate provisions of the relevant legislation implementing certain European Directives.

The CE marking on ConFoot legs signifies that they have been assessed to meet high safety, health, and environmental protection requirements. This is crucial for ensuring the safety of workers and the public when using or handling containers supported by ConFoot legs.

According to Tec Container, "CE marking is the process by which the manufacturer/importer informs users and authorities that the equipment on sale complies with the mandatory safety requirements." [https://www.teccontainer.com/blog/ce-marking/]

### EN 283 Testing

ConFoot legs have been statically and dynamically tested and measured with the very specific CF EN 283 testing program. This testing program ensures that the legs can withstand the loads and stresses associated with container handling and transportation.

EN 283 is a European standard that specifies the requirements for the design, manufacture, and testing of container handling equipment. Compliance with EN 283 ensures that ConFoot legs meet the necessary safety and performance criteria.

### EU Declaration of Conformity

ConFoot provides EU declarations of conformity for its container legs, including models CF, CFP, CFL, and CFU. These declarations attest that the products meet the essential requirements of the applicable EU directives.

The EU declaration of conformity includes details such as:

*   Material certificates

*   Manufacturing quality system and quality certification

These declarations are essential documents that demonstrate ConFoot's commitment to quality and compliance.
