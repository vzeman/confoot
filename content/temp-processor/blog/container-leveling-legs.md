  <tp:section title="Common Mistakes to Avoid">
    <tp:subsection title="Neglecting Ground Preparation">
      <tp:paragraph>
        Skipping proper ground preparation is a common mistake when setting up ISO container leveling legs. If the ground is uneven, soft, or covered with debris, it can make the container unstable, leading to tilting or shifting over time. Seasonal changes, like freezing and thawing, can worsen this instability and cause further misalignment. To avoid these issues, always ensure the ground is even, firm, and free of debris before you start the installation.
      </tp:paragraph>
    </tp:subsection>
    <tp:subsection title="Improper Installation of Leveling Legs">
      <tp:paragraph>
        Attaching or tightening leveling legs incorrectly can create serious problems. If you tighten the bolts too much, you might damage the container's corner castings or the leveling legs themselves. On the other hand, if the bolts are too loose, the legs can detach, making the container unstable. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully. Use the correct tools and double-check that the legs are securely fastened.
      </tp:paragraph>
    </tp:subsection>
    <tp:subsection title="Ignoring Regular Maintenance">
      <tp:paragraph>
        Failing to inspect and maintain leveling legs regularly can lead to problems like rust, wear, or mechanical failure over time. Small issues, such as loose bolts or minor corrosion, can grow into bigger problems that compromise the container's stability. Make it a habit to check the leveling legs for damage, clean off dirt and debris, and lubricate moving parts. This ensures they function smoothly and last longer.
      </tp:paragraph>
    </tp:subsection>
    <tp:subsection title="Overlooking Adequate Drainage">
      <tp:paragraph>
        Not planning for proper drainage around the container can result in water collecting near the base. This pooling can erode the ground, causing the container and its leveling legs to sink or shift. Poor drainage also increases the risk of structural problems, like rust and corrosion. To prevent these issues, create a drainage solution, such as adding a slight slope or installing a French drain system, to redirect water effectively.
      </tp:paragraph>
    </tp:subsection>
    <tp:subsection title="Using Inadequate Support Materials">
      <tp:paragraph>
        Using weak or unstable materials to support the container can lead to sagging or uneven placement. For example, untreated wood or poorly chosen support points may not handle the weight of the container or withstand environmental conditions. Instead, use strong materials like concrete or steel blocks. Place them strategically to distribute the container’s weight evenly and ensure reliable support.
      </tp:paragraph>
      <tp:paragraph>
        By addressing these common mistakes, you can ensure that ISO container leveling legs work as intended, providing a solid and secure foundation for your container.
