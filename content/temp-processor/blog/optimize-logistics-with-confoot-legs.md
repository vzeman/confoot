### Company and Product History of ConFoot

In the early 2000s, Timo Akela, the CEO of ConFoot, faced a challenging logistics problem. His close friend, Veikko Salminen, ran a small company importing furniture from Estonia and supplying it to retailers in Finland. With limited resources and a small fleet, Veikko struggled with an inefficient delivery process.

When Veikko arrived at retailers, he often had to wait for staff to unload the furniture. The stores lacked designated storage areas and teams for quick unloading, leading to long delays. Some stores even asked him to return the next day to pick up the empty container. This loss of time resulted in up to three containers parked simultaneously at loading ramps of different retailers. With tied-up trailers and slow turnover, it was clear that a solution was needed.

Veikko realized he was not the only transport company facing these issues. He turned to Timo and asked, "How can we get a shipping container off a trailer without expensive equipment?" This challenge motivated Timo to search for an innovative solution to facilitate container handling and increase transport efficiency.

### Birth of the Innovative Idea

Timo teamed up with Veikko and his brother-in-law Terho NÃ¤revaara. Together, they began working on the concept of a lightweight and affordable set of legs or supports that would allow for the easy removal of a shipping container from a trailer. These supports were to be attached to the corner castings of the container, allowing the truck to lower the air suspension of the trailer and simply drive away, while the container remained in place for unloading. This would significantly increase the driver's productivity and reduce delivery delays.

### Challenges in Development

However, implementing this idea was not straightforward. The ConFoot team set several key requirements for the final product:

* Lightweight: The product needed to be easily portable and manipulable by one person.  
* Low Cost: Affordability was crucial for widespread market acceptance.  
* Long Lifespan: The supports needed to be durable and reliable for regular use.  
* Safety: They had to meet all safety regulations according to European machinery directives.

To achieve these goals, extensive 3D modeling, load testing, and detailed material strength calculations were necessary. While the concept sounded simple, its realization required collaboration with many experts and engineers.

### First Prototypes and Their Shortcomings

Several prototypes were created during development. Among them was a version shaped like an "I" and other models primarily made of aluminum. However, these initial attempts did not meet the team's high standards. They were not strong, portable, or durable enough to withstand the demanding conditions of transporting and handling heavy containers.

### Breakthrough and Patent of the Innovation

In 2013, after more than ten years of intense research and development, the ConFoot team achieved a significant breakthrough. They discovered a specific blend of six different types of high-strength, high-quality Finnish steel that enabled the creation of supports meeting all established requirements. The new ConFoot legs could bear loads of up to 26 tons while weighing only 24 kg.

This innovation was immediately patented and laid the foundation for the companyâ€™s future success. At the same time, Timo formally established ConFoot Oy based in Helsinki, enhancing the brand's credibility and professionalism.

### Further Improvements Based on Feedback

The ConFoot team continuously listened to their customers' needs. Based on their feedback, further enhancements were made:

* Folding Leg Design: To increase portability and facilitate storage, the legs were designed to fold easily.
