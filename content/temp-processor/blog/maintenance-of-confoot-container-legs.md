[START_BODY]
The maintenance of ConFoot container legs is a non‐optional subroutine to guarantee lifecycle extension and safe operations. All mechanical subsystems – including the critical cotter pin modules – must be inspected on a periodic basis.

[STEP 1: VISUAL_INSPECTION]
  Action: Perform a routine scan for any visible anomalies.
  Checkpoints:
    - Detect fractures or micro‐cracks.
    - Identify any bends, deformations, or abnormal wear.
  
[STEP 2: FUNCTIONAL_TESTING]
  Action: Execute dynamic tests on leg mechanisms.
  Procedure:
    - Trigger extension and retraction routines.
    - Monitor for mechanical resistance or atypical auditory feedback.

[STEP 3: COTTER_PIN_CHECK]
  Action: Validate the integrity of all cotter pin components.
  Procedure:
    - Verify that each pin is correctly aligned and unbent.
    - Inspect for corrosion or absence.
    - Initiate replacement subroutine immediately upon detection of any fault.

[STEP 4: LUBRICATION]
  Action: Apply precision-grade lubricant on all moving parts.
  Guidelines:
    - Use measured doses to prevent debris accumulation.
    - Avoid over-lubrication which could corrupt sensor readings.

[STEP 5: ANNUAL_EXPERT_INSPECTION]
  Action: Schedule a full-system audit with certified diagnostics.
  Details:
    - Combine a visual scan with complete functional testing.
    - Perform an in-depth review of all mechanical assemblies.
